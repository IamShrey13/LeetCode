Q. You are given a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [birthi, deathi] indicates the birth and death years of the ith person. The population of some year x is the number of people alive during that year. The ith person is counted in year x's population if x is in the inclusive range [birthi, deathi - 1]. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die. Return the earliest year with the maximum population.

Answer->

int maximumPopulation(int** logs,int logsSize,int* logsColSize){
    //declaring variables
    int timeline[101]={0},i,birth,death,maxpopulation=0,maxyear=1950,currentpopulation=0;

    //code
    for(i=0;i<logsSize;i++){
        birth=logs[i][0];
        death=logs[i][1];
        timeline[birth-1950]++;
        timeline[death-1950]--;
    }
    for(i=0;i<101;i++){
        currentpopulation+=timeline[i];
        if(currentpopulation>maxpopulation){
            maxpopulation=currentpopulation;
            maxyear=1950+i;
        }
        else if(currentpopulation==maxpopulation && (1950+i)<maxyear){
            maxyear=1950+i;
        }
    }
    return maxyear;
}
